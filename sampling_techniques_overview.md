## Introduction to Sampling

First step of any statistical test or study is sampling. Now, what exactly is sampling? Sampling is a statistical technique used to select a subset of individuals, items, or data points from a larger population or dataset to estimate characteristics of the whole population. You want your sample to well represent the population so you can generalize findings to the population.

## Different Approaches to Sampling

### Probability Sampling (Random Sampling)

Probability sampling is a sampling technique in which every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected in the sample. This type of sampling allows for statistical inferences to be made about the population, as it aims to produce a representative sample. It’s most commonly used for quantitative research, where it aims to find conclusions about the whole population, not the sample itself.

#### Examples of Probability Sampling:

- **Simple Random Sampling:** Each member of the population is chosen randomly and entirely by chance.
  - *Example:* Selecting 10 completely random persons by total luck from a sample of 1000 people.

- **Systematic Sampling:** Members are selected at regular intervals from a randomly ordered list.
  - *Example:* The same sample but instead of being random, you decide that you’ll select (for example) the first person in every 10 people (1st, 11th, 21st, 31st, …).

- **Stratified Sampling:** The population is divided into strata (subgroups) based on common characteristics, and random samples are taken from each stratum.
  - *Example:* From each 10 people in our sample, we’ll randomly select one person.

- **Cluster Sampling:** The population is divided into clusters, some clusters are randomly selected, and all members within chosen clusters are sampled.
  - *Example:* Choosing to select 5 clusters from a 100-person sample, each cluster is 10 persons, but we’ll randomly select those 5 clusters from the sample and then randomly select people from each cluster.

- **Multistage Sampling:** Combines several sampling methods in stages, often starting with clusters and then sampling within those clusters.
  - *Example:*
    - **Stage 1:** Use cluster sampling to select clusters.
    - **Stage 2:** Within each selected cluster, use another sampling method (e.g., simple random sampling) to select members.

### Non-Probability Sampling

Non-probability sampling is a sampling technique where some elements of the population have no chance of being selected, or the probability of selection cannot be accurately determined. This type of sampling does not aim to produce a representative sample and is often used when probability sampling is not feasible. It’s most commonly used in qualitative research, where the researcher prioritizes the depth and richness of data rather than the quantity of data.

#### Examples of Non-Probability Sampling:

- **Convenience Sampling:** Samples are selected based on ease of access.
  - *Example:* Sampling people at the mall gate because they’re the easiest to access.

- **Judgmental or Purposive Sampling:** Samples are selected based on the researcher's knowledge and judgment.
  - *Example:* A researcher studying expert opinions on climate change selects known climate scientists for interviews.

- **Quota Sampling:** Ensures certain characteristics are represented in the sample but does not use random selection within those characteristics.
  - *Example:* Set quotas for each subgroup. For example, if you want to ensure that your sample has 30% females and 70% males, you would have quotas for each group, then non-randomly select participants within each subgroup until the quota is met. This can be done through convenience sampling, judgment sampling.

- **Snowball Sampling:** Relies on referrals from initial participants to involve another certain participant. This method is better for finding hard-to-reach or particular populations.

- **Self-Selection Sampling:** Individuals volunteer to participate.

## When to Use Which Sampling Method

### Probability Sampling:

- **Simple Random Sampling:** Use when the population is homogeneous, and you want to avoid bias.
- **Systematic Sampling:** Use when the population is homogeneous, and a complete list of the population is available.
- **Stratified Sampling:** Use when the population is heterogeneous and you want to ensure representation of specific subgroups.
- **Cluster Sampling:** Use when the population is large and spread over a wide area, making other methods impractical.

### Non-Probability Sampling:

- **Convenience Sampling:** Use when quick, inexpensive insights are needed, and precision is not critical.
- **Purposive Sampling (Judgmental):** Use when expert knowledge is needed to select a representative sample.
- **Snowball Sampling:** Use when studying hard-to-reach or hidden populations.
- **Quota Sampling:** Use when ensuring representation of specific subgroups is important, but random sampling is not feasible.
- **Self-Selection Sampling:** Use when studying highly motivated individuals or for exploratory research where voluntary response is sufficient.

Finally, always consider your research aims and questions when deciding which sampling method to use.
